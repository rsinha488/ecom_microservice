/**
 * Decorator that marks a constructor parameter as a target for
 * [Dependency Injection (DI)](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers#dependency-injection).
 *
 * Any injected provider must be visible within the module scope (loosely
 * speaking, the containing module) of the class it is being injected into. This
 * can be done by:
 *
 * - defining the provider in the same module scope
 * - exporting the provider from one module scope and importing that module into the
 *   module scope of the class being injected into
 * - exporting the provider from a module that is marked as global using the
 *   `@Global()` decorator
 *
 * #### Injection tokens
 * Can be *types* (class names), *strings* or *symbols*. This depends on how the
 * provider with which it is associated was defined. Providers defined with the
 * `@Injectable()` decorator use the class name. Custom Providers may use strings
 * or symbols as the injection token.
 *
 * @param token lookup key for the provider to be injected (assigned to the constructor
 * parameter).
